# TFM_Startups_Gacela
Final project of my master's degree in Data Science. Classification of high growth startups and sales prediction to determine new Gazelle Startups.

Data > Has all the data used in the project

ACTIVO_PASIVO_CR_RELEVANCIA > Select the data and preprocess it before using it in the models. The exit is a dataset named 'df_nietos2.csv'

PRED_ALTO_CREC > Has the Python scripts used to make the classification machine learning model to classify high growth startups. The first part of the Python script is about preprocessing the missing data. The exit is a dataset named 'data2.csv'. 

PRED_VENTAS > Has the Python Scripts used to predict the sales

PRED_GACELAS > Has the Python Scripts used to determine if a startup would be consider a Gazelle based on the results of the high growth classification and the sales prediction. 

ANALISIS_DATOS > A PowerBI to analyze the data
